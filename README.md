# Face Recognition-Based Attendance System

## Project Overview
The Face Recognition-Based Attendance System is designed to automate the process of recording student attendance using facial recognition technology. This system provides a secure and efficient way of tracking attendance, reducing the need for manual intervention.

## Status
**Under Development**

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: OpenCV, dlib, NumPy
- **Tools**: VIM (for code editing), Python Virtual Environment

## Features (Planned)
- **Real-time Face Detection**: Capture and detect faces using a connected webcam or video feed.
- **Facial Recognition Matching**: Identify students and match their faces against a pre-trained dataset.
- **Automated Attendance Logging**: Mark attendance for recognized students and log details into a database or CSV file.
- **User Interface**: Simple UI for recording and viewing attendance reports.

## Installation Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/face-recognition-attendance.git
   cd face-recognition-attendance
   ```
2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
- Ensure your webcam is connected and accessible by the application.
- Run `main.py` to initiate the system and follow the on-screen prompts.
